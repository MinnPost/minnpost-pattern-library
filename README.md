# MinnPost Pattern Library
Attempt to create a reusable pattern library, based on current styles, that we can expand, improve, redesign, etc.

This includes Sass, Grunt, Bourbon, Neat, and Normalizer.

## Grunt Setup
> Basic project setup with Grunt to standardise and structure projects.

### What's included?
- JShint, concatenate and minify JavaScript
- Compiles Sass with development and production options
- Rasterize `.svg` files
- Compress `.jpg/.jpeg`, `.png` and `.svg` files

### Getting Started
Make sure you have Node.js and Grunt installed:

- Install Node.js from [http://nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org), or if you use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/): `brew install node`
- Install Grunt by running `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- Install project dependancies with `npm install`. Make sure you're in the project root.

You may need to run the install commands as admin, so for Mac, use `sudo npm install`.
